# Digit-Recognizer

### Recognizes Hand-Written Digits(example: Digit written on a white paper)
### ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## This code helps you classify different digits using Softmax Classifier.
## ==> The CNN model is trained using MNIST dataset so that it can recognize hand written digits.
## ==> A Softmax Classifier is used since it is a multiclass setting.
## ==> Input is being taken via WebCam . 
## ==> The input is then provided to the model and the result is predicted and displayed using OpenCV.
